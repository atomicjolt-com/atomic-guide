Review the most recent changes and summarize the features added. Update the documentation. Start with README.md at the root of the project. Review the document structure and notice that the documentation is broken into smaller documents store in the /docs directory. Determine the best location to document the new features and update the docs accordingly. Review the existing documents first. Should your changes go into one of those documents? If so please proceed and update the existing documentation. If the features don't fit into existing documentation then create a new file and link to it. Be direct. Include summaries. Remember the reader's time is valuable and so be as succint as possible.
