# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Achieve 50-80% improvement in knowledge retention through retrieval practice (Adesope et al., 2017: g=0.50-0.80) and optimal spaced repetition (Cepeda et al., 2008: 35-50% improvement)
- Reduce STEM gateway course failure rates by 15-25% using adaptive difficulty adjustment (Chrysafiadi et al., 2023: 23% improvement) and early intervention systems (Gardner Institute, 2023: 10-15% retention improvement)
- Create portable "Learner DNA" profiles incorporating individual forgetting curves, optimal spacing intervals, and personalized difficulty thresholds across environments
- Build trust through faculty champions using conversational assessment to increase engagement by 35% (Yildirim-Erbasli & Bulut, 2023) while reducing test anxiety
- Deliver <100ms response times globally through edge computing architecture with robust fallbacks
- Enable cross-course intelligence using knowledge dependency graphs and prerequisite mapping, predicting struggles with 70-80% accuracy based on prior performance patterns

## Background Context

Atomic Guide addresses the critical problem that 70% of learning is forgotten within 24 hours (Murre & Dros, 2015) by creating a Progressive Cognitive Learning Infrastructure platform. The solution combines research-backed cognitive science with real-time AI optimization to deliver measurable retention improvements of 50-80% through retrieval practice (Adesope et al., 2017) and 35-50% through optimal spaced repetition (Cepeda et al., 2008). Initially focused on STEM gateway courses where failure rates of 15-30% create significant institutional costs ($13,000+ per student in excess credits, Kramer et al., 2018), the platform leverages proven interventions that reduce DFW rates by 10-15% (Tyton Partners, 2022). In the current higher education landscape, with 17:1 student-to-faculty ratios and 47% part-time faculty (NCES, 2024), personalized learning at scale has become impossible without technological intervention that respects both student privacy and faculty autonomy.

The platform leverages unique access to academic journey data via LTI 1.3 integration, creating cross-course intelligence that no existing solution provides. By combining institutional credibility through LMS integration with universal AI enhancement through MCP (Model Context Protocol), Atomic Guide creates portable cognitive profiles that transform institutional learning data into personal learning assets. The system is designed with privacy-first principles, giving students control over their data while providing faculty with actionable insights that enhance rather than replace their teaching methods.
