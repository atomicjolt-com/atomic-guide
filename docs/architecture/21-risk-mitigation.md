# 21. Risk Mitigation

## Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                        | Impact | Mitigation                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1 scalability limits       | High   | Implement caching layer, optimize queries, monitor usage             |
| AI API latency              | High   | Stream responses, implement timeout handling, cache common responses |
| Canvas API rate limits      | Medium | Queue requests, implement exponential backoff, cache roster data     |
| WebSocket connection limits | Medium | Use connection pooling, implement reconnection logic                 |
| Worker CPU time limits      | High   | Optimize code paths, use Durable Objects for state management        |

## Operational Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                         | Impact | Mitigation                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AI content quality issues    | High   | Instructor approval workflow, content filtering, feedback loop      |
| Student gaming the system    | Medium | Response analysis, plagiarism detection, varied question generation |
| Integration breaking changes | High   | Version pinning, comprehensive testing, gradual rollout             |
| Cost overruns from AI usage  | Medium | Token usage monitoring, rate limiting, tiered access                |
