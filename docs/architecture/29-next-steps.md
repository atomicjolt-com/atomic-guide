# 29. Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

To begin implementation of this unified architecture:

- Reference this architecture document for all technical decisions
- Key integration requirements: Preserve all LTI functionality, implement D1 with tenant isolation
- Existing system constraints: 50ms CPU limit, iframe security requirements
- First story: Set up D1 database with multi-tenant schema including chat tables
- Maintain existing system integrity by feature-flagging all enhancements

## Developer Handoff

For developers starting implementation:

- This architecture extends the existing LTI starter - study current codebase first
- Follow existing TypeScript/Prettier/ESLint conventions already in place
- Integration requirements: All new APIs under /api/v1, preserve existing routes
- Key technical decisions: Redux Toolkit for state, CSS modules with variables, MCP via OAuth
- Implementation sequence: 1) D1 setup with chat tables, 2) Basic API routes, 3) React components with chat, 4) Cognitive engine, 5) MCP integration
- Verify LTI launches still work after each major change

## UI/UX Implementation Guidelines

When implementing the front-end components, developers should:

1. **Reference the Front-End Spec:** Always consult `docs/front-end-spec.md` for:
   - Exact pixel dimensions and spacing
   - Color values and usage guidelines
   - Typography specifications
   - Animation timings and easing functions
   - Accessibility requirements

2. **Use Design Tokens:** Implement all styles using CSS custom properties defined in `variables.css`

3. **Follow Component Patterns:** Each component in the spec has:
   - Visual hierarchy guidelines
   - State management requirements
   - Interaction patterns
   - Responsive behavior
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Maintain Brand Voice:** Follow the voice and tone guidelines:
   - Encouraging and supportive
   - Clear and concise
   - Academic but approachable
   - Confident without being condescending
