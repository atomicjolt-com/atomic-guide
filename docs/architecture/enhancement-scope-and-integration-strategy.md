# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

Based on the PRD analysis, this enhancement transforms a basic LTI starter into a comprehensive cognitive learning platform with:

**Enhancement Overview:**

- **Enhancement Type:** Major Feature Addition - Progressive Cognitive Learning System
- **Scope:** Complete platform build including multi-tenant data layer, cognitive profiling, real-time monitoring, AI integration
- **Integration Impact:** High - Requires new data layer (D1), React UI framework, WebSocket connections, MCP server
- **Target Market:** Higher education STEM gateway courses initially, expanding to K-12 and workforce training
- **Pricing Model:** $3-7 per student annually (institutional licensing $10K-$50K based on enrollment)

**Integration Approach:**

- **Code Integration:** Preserve all existing LTI endpoints while adding new API routes under `/api/` namespace
- **Database Integration:** KV remains for platform configs; D1 added for learner data with tenant isolation
- **API Integration:** Existing LTI routes untouched; new REST/WebSocket APIs for cognitive features
- **UI Integration:** Extend launch page to React router; preserve existing vanilla JS for LTI flows
- **MCP Integration:** Deploy Cloudflare's native MCP library at `/mcp` endpoint with OAuth 2.0 authentication (GitHub/Google/institutional SSO) for secure AI client access to Learner DNA profiles

**Compatibility Requirements:**

- **Existing API Compatibility:** All LTI 1.3 endpoints remain unchanged at current paths
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** KV namespaces retained; D1 operates independently with tenant_id partitioning
- **UI/UX Consistency:** React components styled to match Canvas aesthetic; non-intrusive overlays
- **Performance Impact:** Target <100ms response maintained via edge computing; D1 queries optimized to 10-50ms
- **MCP OAuth Security:** Learner consent required before AI client access; token-scoped to specific learner profiles
