# S-Tier SaaS Dashboard Design Checklist

## I. Core Design Philosophy & Strategy

- [ ] **Users First:** Prioritize user needs, workflows, and ease of use in every design decision.
- [ ] **Meticulous Craft:** Aim for precision, polish, and high quality in every UI element and interaction.
- [ ] **Speed & Performance:** Design for fast load times and snappy, responsive interactions.
- [ ] **Simplicity & Clarity:** Strive for a clean, uncluttered interface. Ensure labels, instructions, and information are unambiguous.
- [ ] **Focus & Efficiency:** Help users achieve their goals quickly and with minimal friction. Minimize unnecessary steps or distractions.
- [ ] **Consistency:** Maintain a uniform design language (colors, typography, components, patterns) across the entire dashboard.
- [ ] **Accessibility (WCAG AA+):** Design for inclusivity. Ensure sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility.
- [ ] **Opinionated Design (Thoughtful Defaults):** Establish clear, efficient default workflows and settings, reducing decision fatigue for users.

## II. Design System Foundation (Tokens & Core Components)

  - [ ] **Avatars**

---

- [ ] **Shadows (Elevation System):**
  - [ ] Levels: `xxsmall, xsmall, small, medium, large, xlarge, xxlarge`
  - [ ] Usage:
    - Small: inputs, cards
    - Medium: dropdowns, modals
    - Large: overlays, dialogs

## III. Layout, Visual Hierarchy & Structure

- [ ] **Responsive Grid System:** Design based on a responsive grid (e.g., 12-column) for consistent layout across devices.
- [ ] **Strategic White Space:** Use ample negative space to improve clarity, reduce cognitive load, and create visual balance.
- [ ] **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Guide the user's eye using typography (size, weight, color), spacing, and element positioning.
- [ ] **Consistent Alignment:** Maintain consistent alignment of elements.
- [ ] **Main Dashboard Layout:**
  - [ ] Persistent Left Sidebar: For primary navigation between modules.
  - [ ] Content Area: Main space for module-specific interfaces.
  - [ ] (Optional) Top Bar: For global search, user profile, notifications.
- [ ] **Mobile-First Considerations:** Ensure the design adapts gracefully to smaller screens.

## IV. Interaction Design & Animations

- [ ] **Purposeful Micro-interactions:** Use subtle animations and visual feedback for user actions (hovers, clicks, form submissions, status changes).
  - [ ] Feedback should be immediate and clear.
  - [ ] Animations should be quick (150-300ms) and use appropriate easing (e.g., ease-in-out).
- [ ] **Loading States:** Implement clear loading indicators (skeleton screens for page loads, spinners for in-component actions).
- [ ] **Transitions:** Use smooth transitions for state changes, modal appearances, and section expansions.
- [ ] **Avoid Distraction:** Animations should enhance usability, not overwhelm or slow down the user.
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible and focus states are clear.

## V. Specific Module Design Tactics

### A. Multimedia Moderation Module

- [ ] **Clear Media Display:** Prominent image/video previews (grid or list view).
- [ ] **Obvious Moderation Actions:** Clearly labeled buttons (Approve, Reject, Flag, etc.) with distinct styling (e.g., primary/secondary, color-coding). Use icons for quick recognition.
- [ ] **Visible Status Indicators:** Use color-coded Badges for content status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
- [ ] **Contextual Information:** Display relevant metadata (uploader, timestamp, flags) alongside media.
- [ ] **Workflow Efficiency:**
  - [ ] Bulk Actions: Allow selection and moderation of multiple items.
  - [ ] Keyboard Shortcuts: For common moderation actions.
- [ ] **Minimize Fatigue:** Clean, uncluttered interface; consider dark mode option.

### B. Data Tables Module (Contacts, Admin Settings)

- [ ] **Readability & Scannability:**
  - [ ] Smart Alignment: Left-align text, right-align numbers.
  - [ ] Clear Headers: Bold column headers.
  - [ ] Zebra Striping (Optional): For dense tables.
  - [ ] Legible Typography: Simple, clean sans-serif fonts.
  - [ ] Adequate Row Height & Spacing.
- [ ] **Interactive Controls:**
  - [ ] Column Sorting: Clickable headers with sort indicators.
  - [ ] Intuitive Filtering: Accessible filter controls (dropdowns, text inputs) above the table.
  - [ ] Global Table Search.
- [ ] **Large Datasets:**
  - [ ] Pagination (preferred for admin tables) or virtual/infinite scroll.
  - [ ] Sticky Headers / Frozen Columns: If applicable.
- [ ] **Row Interactions:**
  - [ ] Expandable Rows: For detailed information.
  - [ ] Inline Editing: For quick modifications.
  - [ ] Bulk Actions: Checkboxes and contextual toolbar.
  - [ ] Action Icons/Buttons per Row: (Edit, Delete, View Details) clearly distinguishable.

### C. Configuration Panels Module (Microsite, Admin Settings)

- [ ] **Clarity & Simplicity:** Clear, unambiguous labels for all settings. Concise helper text or tooltips for descriptions. Avoid jargon.
- [ ] **Logical Grouping:** Group related settings into sections or tabs.
- [ ] **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide advanced or less-used settings by default (e.g., behind "Advanced Settings" toggle, accordions).
- [ ] **Appropriate Input Types:** Use correct form controls (text fields, checkboxes, toggles, selects, sliders) for each setting.
- [ ] **Visual Feedback:** Immediate confirmation of changes saved (e.g., toast notifications, inline messages). Clear error messages for invalid inputs.
- [ ] **Sensible Defaults:** Provide default values for all settings.
- [ ] **Reset Option:** Easy way to "Reset to Defaults" for sections or entire configuration.
- [ ] **Microsite Preview (If Applicable):** Show a live or near-live preview of microsite changes.

## VI. CSS & Styling Architecture

- [ ] **Choose a Scalable CSS Methodology:**
- [ ] **BEM with CSS variables:** Use structured BEM naming with CSS variables for tokens.
- [ ] **CSS-in-JS (Scoped Styles):** Avoid using CSS directly in javascript or React components.
- [ ] **Integrate Design Tokens:** Ensure colors, fonts, spacing, radii tokens are directly usable in the chosen CSS architecture.
- [ ] **Maintainability & Readability:** Code should be well-organized and easy to understand.
- [ ] **Performance:** Optimize CSS delivery; avoid unnecessary bloat.

## VII. General Best Practices
