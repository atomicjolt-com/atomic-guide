### 3. Review Comments

**Providing Feedback:**

Use clear, constructive feedback with suggestions:

```markdown
# ‚úÖ GOOD: Constructive feedback with suggestions
**Issue:** This function is missing error handling for the API call.

**Suggestion:**
```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new APIError(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
  }
  return await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  throw new ProcessingError('Failed to fetch data', error);
}
```

**Reasoning:** This ensures proper error handling and provides meaningful error messages for debugging.

# ‚ùå BAD: Vague criticism without suggestions
This doesn't look right. Fix the error handling.
```

**Review Categories:**

Use these labels for review comments:

- üö® **BLOCKING:** Must be fixed before merge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **SUGGESTION:** Recommended improvement  
- üí≠ **QUESTION:** Seeking clarification
- üëç **APPROVAL:** Good implementation
- üìù **NITPICK:** Minor style/preference issue

### 4. Responding to Reviews

**As PR Author:**

1. **Address all feedback** before requesting re-review
2. **Respond to each comment** with your changes or reasoning
3. **Ask for clarification** if feedback is unclear
4. **Update documentation** if implementation changed significantly
5. **Re-run tests** after making changes

**Example Response:**
```markdown
Thanks for the feedback! I've addressed the issues:

1. ‚úÖ Added proper error handling in `VideoProcessor.processVideo()`
2. ‚úÖ Updated tests to cover the new error scenarios
3. ‚úÖ Added JSDoc documentation for the new error types

Regarding the suggestion about caching - I initially didn't implement it to keep the PR scope focused, but I agree it would be beneficial. I've created #789 to track adding caching in a follow-up PR.

Ready for re-review! üöÄ
```

## Merge Process

### 1. Merge Requirements

Before merging, ensure:

- [ ] All automated checks pass
- [ ] Required approvals obtained
- [ ] All review comments resolved
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Documentation is complete

### 2. Merge Strategies

**Squash and Merge (Default):**
Use for feature branches with multiple commits:

```bash
# Squash commits into single commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat(video): implement real-time transcription processing

- Add WebSocket-based transcription streaming
- Implement progress tracking and error handling  
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Update API documentation

Closes #123"
```

**Merge Commit:**
Use for important milestones or release branches:

```bash
# Preserve commit history for significant features
git merge --no-ff feature/major-feature
```

**Rebase and Merge:**
Use for small, clean commits that should preserve individual history:

```bash
# Maintain linear history for small, focused changes
git rebase main
git merge --ff-only
```

### 3. Post-Merge Actions

After successful merge:

1. **Delete feature branch** (automated)
2. **Deploy to staging** for integration testing
3. **Update issue status** and notify stakeholders
4. **Monitor deployment** for any issues
5. **Update documentation** if needed

## Special PR Types

### 1. Hotfix PRs

For critical production issues:

**Process:**
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Implement minimal fix with tests
3. Fast-track review with single approval
4. Deploy immediately after merge
5. Follow up with comprehensive fix if needed

**Template:**
```markdown
## üö® HOTFIX: Critical Issue Title

### Issue
Critical production issue requiring immediate fix.

### Root Cause
Brief explanation of what caused the issue.

### Fix
Minimal changes made to resolve the issue immediately.

### Testing
- [ ] Issue reproduction confirmed
- [ ] Fix verified in staging
- [ ] Regression testing completed

### Follow-up
Link to comprehensive fix issue: #XXX
```

### 2. Breaking Change PRs

For changes that break existing functionality:

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Breaking changes clearly documented
- [ ] Migration guide provided
- [ ] Backward compatibility considered
- [ ] Version bump planned
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

**Template Addition:**
```markdown
## üí• Breaking Changes

### What breaks
- API endpoint X now requires authentication
- Component Y props interface changed
- Database schema Z modified

### Migration Guide
1. Update API calls to include authentication
2. Update component usage:
   ```tsx
   // Before
   <Component prop="value" />
   
   // After  
   <Component newProp="value" />
   ```
3. Run migration: `npm run db:migrate`

### Compatibility
- Minimum version: v2.0.0
- Deprecation timeline: 2 weeks
- Support end date: [Date]
```

### 3. Documentation-Only PRs

For documentation improvements:

**Fast-track criteria:**
- Only markdown/documentation files changed
- No code changes
- Single approval sufficient
- Can merge immediately after approval

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Merge Conflicts

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Keep branch updated with main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Resolve conflicts manually
git status
# Edit conflicted files
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch
```

### 2. Failed CI Checks

**TypeScript Errors:**
```bash
# Fix compilation issues
npm run check
# Address all TypeScript errors before pushing
```

**Test Failures:**
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test
# Fix failing tests
npm test -- --coverage
# Ensure coverage meets requirements
```

**Linting Issues:**
```bash
# Auto-fix common issues
npm run lint-fix
# Manually fix remaining issues
npm run lint
```

### 3. Large PR Management

**Break down large PRs:**
1. Create tracking issue for overall feature
2. Split into smaller, reviewable PRs
3. Use draft PRs for work in progress
4. Link related PRs in descriptions

**Example Structure:**
```
Epic: Real-time Chat Feature (#100)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PR #101: Add WebSocket infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PR #102: Implement message storage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PR #103: Build chat UI components  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PR #104: Add user presence system
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PR #105: Integration and testing
```

## Best Practices

### 1. PR Size Guidelines

**Optimal PR size:**
- **Small:** < 100 lines changed (ideal)
- **Medium:** 100-300 lines changed (acceptable)  
- **Large:** 300-500 lines changed (requires justification)
- **Extra Large:** > 500 lines changed (should be split)

### 2. Communication

**In PR descriptions:**
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Include context for business decisions
- Link to relevant issues and discussions
- Provide testing instructions

**During review:**
- Respond promptly to feedback
- Be open to suggestions and alternatives  
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- Thank reviewers for their time

### 3. Quality Standards

**Before requesting review:**
- Self-review your own code first
- Test all changed functionality manually
- Verify documentation is accurate
- Check for any debugging code left behind

**Maintain consistency:**
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Use existing utilities before creating new ones
- Match the style of surrounding code
- Adhere to naming conventions

By following these pull request guidelines, we maintain high code quality, facilitate effective collaboration, and ensure smooth project evolution.
