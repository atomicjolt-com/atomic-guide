# 1. Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source:** IDE-based analysis combined with comprehensive architecture documentation (v1.5)

**Current Project State:**
Atomic Guide is an LTI 1.3 tool provider starter application with Canvas LMS integration, built on Cloudflare Workers using Hono framework. The architecture employs serverless edge computing with event-driven LTI handlers, KV namespaces for storage, and Durable Objects for state management. The project is positioned to evolve into a Progressive Cognitive Learning Infrastructure platform with documented architectural plans for AI-enhanced features, achieving 50-80% improvement in knowledge retention through retrieval practice.

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation:**

- ✓ Tech Stack Documentation (comprehensive architecture v1.5)
- ✓ Source Tree/Architecture (documented with React migration plans)
- ✓ Coding Standards (established patterns)
- ✓ API Documentation (LTI and Canvas integration)
- ✓ Front-End Specification (`docs/front-end-spec.md` with design system)
- ✓ Product Requirements (`docs/prd.md` defining Atomic Guide)
- ✓ Canvas postMessage Architecture (v1.3 documented)
- ✓ Cognitive Science Integration (empirical foundations documented)

**Note:** Architecture already includes plans for AI Guide chat interface and real-time components (v1.1), providing natural integration points for deep linking assessment features.

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type:** ✓ New Feature Addition - Deep linking formative assessment with AI conversational capabilities

**Enhancement Description:**
Implementing the planned AI-powered assessment features that enable instructors to embed contextual learning checkpoints into Canvas assignments through deep linking. This builds on the documented Canvas postMessage architecture (v1.3) and AI Guide chat interface plans (v1.1), creating conversational assessment experiences aligned with the cognitive science foundations already established.

**Impact Assessment:** ✓ Significant Impact - Extends planned D1 database adoption, implements designed AI chat architecture, leverages documented Canvas postMessage integration, and aligns with React migration path (v1.2)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**

- Achieve documented 35% engagement increase through conversational assessment
- Enable real-time struggle detection using Durable Objects as architecturally planned
- Create "Learner DNA" profiles with individualized learning patterns
- Reduce STEM gateway course failure rates by 15-25% through adaptive assessment
- Provide 70-80% accuracy in predicting performance challenges

**Background Context:**
The architecture already anticipates this enhancement with AI Guide chat interface plans (v1.1) and Canvas postMessage integration (v1.3). The deep linking assessment feature directly implements the vision of transforming the LTI starter into a Progressive Cognitive Learning Infrastructure. This maintains backward compatibility with existing LTI launches while adding the intelligent assessment layer that creates feedback loops between content and comprehension.

**Key Integration Insights:**

- Foundation provides 80% of required authentication infrastructure
- Natural extension points exist in client entry system for assessment UI
- Durable Objects perfectly suited for conversation state management
- Incremental enhancement path available without breaking changes
