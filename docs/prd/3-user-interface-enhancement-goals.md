# 3. User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The new assessment features will integrate with Atomic Guide's existing design system by:

- Extending the planned floating action button (FAB) for AI Guide chat to include assessment-specific conversation flows
- Utilizing existing Atomic Jolt component patterns and color schemes (documented in design-system-implementation.md)
- Maintaining frame-friendly layouts for LMS iframe embedding with responsive breakpoints
- Following established accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance) for all new components
- Leveraging the React migration path (architecture v1.2) for new component development

## Modified/New Screens and Views

## UI Consistency Requirements

To maintain visual and interaction consistency:

**Visual Consistency:**

- Use Atomic Jolt's established color palette (primary blue #0066CC, success green #00A651)
- Maintain existing typography scale (Inter font family, established size hierarchy)
- Follow current spacing system (8px grid with 4px increments)
- Apply consistent elevation/shadow patterns for modals and overlays
- Use existing icon library with new assessment-specific additions

**Interaction Consistency:**

- Preserve current navigation patterns (top nav, sidebar for dashboards)
- Maintain existing form validation and error messaging styles
- Use established loading states and skeleton screens
- Follow current modal behavior (overlay opacity, close interactions)
- Apply consistent animation timing (200ms transitions)

**Component Reuse:**

- Leverage existing Button, Input, Select components from current library
- Extend Card components for assessment display
- Reuse Alert and Toast notification patterns
- Apply existing Table components for instructor dashboards
- Utilize current Chart components for analytics visualizations
