# Epic List

**Epic 1: Multi-Tenant Foundation + AI Guide Chat MVP**
Establish multi-tenant infrastructure with D1 database provisioning, extend existing LTI 1.3 integration, and deliver immediate value through AI Guide chat interface MVP. This includes floating action button, basic chat UI, LMS content extraction, and context-aware Q&A capabilities. This ensures both technical foundation and core user-facing value from Day 1.

**Epic 2: Enhanced Chat Intelligence + Student Dashboard**
Expand chat capabilities with conversation memory, personalized explanations based on learning style, proactive help suggestions, and rich media responses. Add basic student learning dashboard showing chat history, saved explanations, and personal insights. This creates sticky user engagement.

**Epic 3: Learner DNA Core + Privacy Controls**
Build the cognitive profiling system that captures memory patterns, learning velocity, and engagement DNA with comprehensive privacy controls, data management interfaces, and student consent workflows. This establishes trust while building core algorithms.

**Epic 4: Struggle Detection + Proactive Chat Interventions**
Implement custom postMessage monitoring, real-time struggle pattern detection via Durable Objects, and proactive chat interventions. Chat bot initiates conversations when struggle is detected. This proves the core concept with measurable learning improvements.

**Epic 5: Cross-Course Intelligence**
Create knowledge dependency mapping, prerequisite gap analysis, and performance prediction algorithms using Cloudflare AI models. Chat interface leverages this to provide predictive help. This delivers the unique differentiation that no competitor offers.

**Epic 6: Faculty Tools + Chat Analytics**
Build faculty dashboard showing aggregate chat interactions, common confusion points, and learning bottlenecks. Enable faculty to customize chat responses and add course-specific explanations. This creates faculty buy-in and improves content.

**Epic 7: MCP/AI Enhancement**
Implement Model Context Protocol endpoints, enable Learner DNA delivery to AI clients (Claude, ChatGPT), and create portable profile management. This expands the platform beyond institutional boundaries.

**Epic 8: Advanced Analytics & Optimization**
Build sophisticated analytics for academic success coaches, advanced chat effectiveness metrics, A/B testing framework for response strategies, and algorithm optimization based on real usage data. This refines and optimizes based on lessons learned.
