# Market Analysis & Competitive Positioning

## Educational Technology Landscape Gaps

### Traditional LMS Limitations (e.g., Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle)

- Focus on content delivery without adaptive learning capabilities
- Lack integrated spaced repetition and retention tools
- No cross-course intelligence or prerequisite tracking
- Missing real-time struggle detection and intervention

### Spaced Repetition Platform Shortcomings (Anki, Quizlet)

- Require manual content creation by students
- Limited to simple fact memorization without conceptual understanding
- No integration with institutional learning systems
- Lack instructor visibility and curriculum alignment

### AI Tutoring Platform Constraints (Carnegie Learning, Third Space Learning)

- Subject-specific implementations without cross-disciplinary support
- High costs ($50-200 per student) limiting accessibility
- Require significant instructor training and onboarding
- Separate platforms creating workflow disruption
