# Theoretical & Empirical Support

## Cognitive Science Foundation

Atomic Guide is built on rigorously validated cognitive science principles with demonstrated efficacy:

### Memory Consolidation and Retrieval Dynamics

- Leverages the New Theory of Disuse (Bjork & Bjork, 1992) distinguishing between storage strength (permanent) and retrieval strength (temporary accessibility)
- Implements optimal spacing intervals at 10-30% of desired retention interval (Cepeda et al., 2008), with 35-50% improvement over massed practice
- Memory consolidation occurs in waves requiring 24-48 hour intervals for synaptic consolidation (Dudai et al., 2015)
- Validates Ebbinghaus forgetting curve showing 70% information loss within 24 hours without review (Murre & Dros, 2015)

### Retrieval Practice Effects

- Meta-analysis of 217 effect sizes shows practice testing produces g=0.50 effect size across 67,234 participants (Adesope et al., 2017)
- Closed-book testing (d=0.80) outperforms open-book (d=0.51) but both beat passive review (Agarwal et al., 2008)
- Critical finding: Testing is learning, not just assessment - produces 50% better retention than restudying (Karpicke & Roediger, 2008)
- Multiple-choice practice yields stronger effects than short-answer, benefits persist across retention intervals

### Adaptive Learning Optimization

- Fuzzy logic difficulty adjustment improves outcomes by 23% while maintaining flow state (Chrysafiadi et al., 2023)
- Adaptive spacing outperforms fixed spacing by 15-20% with better transfer to novel problems (Mettler et al., 2020)
- ACT-R cognitive models predict optimal schedules with 35% retention improvement (Pavlik & Anderson, 2008)
- Target 70-80% success rate for optimal challenge level without frustration

### Social-Interactive Learning

- Conversational assessment increases test-taking effort by 35% while reducing anxiety (Yildirim-Erbasli & Bulut, 2023)
- High-competency pedagogical agents best for informational support, peer-like agents for motivation (Kim & Baylor, 2006)
- Agent presence increases time-on-task by 40%, critical for struggling learners
- Multimedia principles: Remove extraneous content (d=0.86), highlight essentials (d=0.48), segment content (d=0.61) (Mayer & Fiorella, 2021)

## Optimal Parameters from Research

- **Testing Frequency:** 2-3 times per week for optimal retention
- **Initial Spacing:** 1-2 days for first review, exponentially increasing
- **Spacing Formula:** Gap = 10-30% of desired retention interval
- **Success Rate Target:** 70-80% for maintaining optimal challenge
- **Session Length:** 20-30 minutes maximum for sustained attention
- **Review Threshold:** Trigger review when confidence drops below 85%
- **Feedback Timing:** Immediate for facts, delayed for conceptual understanding
