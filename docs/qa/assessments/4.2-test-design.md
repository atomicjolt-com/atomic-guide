  };
}
```

#### 10.1.3 Privacy and Compliance Metrics

```typescript
interface PrivacyMetrics {
  consentCompliance: {
    target: 100; // Feature scaling based on consent
    critical: 100; // Must be 100% - no privacy failures acceptable
  };

  dataMinimization: {
    target: 100; // Only necessary data collection
    critical: 100; // Must be 100% - privacy requirement
  };

  auditTrailCompleteness: {
    target: 100; // All data access logged
    critical: 95; // Minimum audit coverage
  };

  consentWithdrawal: {
    target: 2; // Maximum percentage of consent withdrawals
    critical: 5; // Maximum acceptable withdrawal rate
  };
