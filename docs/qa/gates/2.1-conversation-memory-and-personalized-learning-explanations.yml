  SECURITY REVIEW COMPLETE - STORY 2.1 APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

  All critical security vulnerabilities have been successfully resolved:
  ✅ SQL injection prevention: Parameterized queries implemented throughout
  ✅ XSS protection: Comprehensive HTML entity escaping in all user content rendering
  ✅ Input validation: Zod schema validation with proper error handling
  ✅ Content sanitization: Server-side sanitization removes malicious patterns
  ✅ Security testing: XSS and injection prevention validated in test suite

  The implementation demonstrates excellent architectural design with robust security measures.
  Story 2.1 now meets all security standards and is ready for production deployment.
  The conversation memory and personalized learning features will provide significant
  value for learners while maintaining a secure platform environment.

  Risk profile has been reduced from HIGH (8/10) to LOW (1/10) for security concerns.
  Future optimizations (rate limiting, performance monitoring) are recommended but
  not required for initial deployment.
