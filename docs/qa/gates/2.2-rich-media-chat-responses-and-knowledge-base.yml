      Story 2.2 achieves CONDITIONAL_PASS status based on:
      
      STRENGTHS:
      - 95.3% test pass rate exceeds minimum 95% requirement
      - Security implementation fully complete with zero vulnerabilities
      - Core functionality (LaTeX rendering, FAQ system) performs excellently
      - Critical path acceptance criteria (15/18) substantially verified
      - Performance benchmarks met for primary use cases
      
      CONDITIONS FOR FULL ACCEPTANCE:
      - Complete mobile device performance validation
      - Finish cross-browser compatibility testing (remaining 10% desktop, 30% mobile)
      - Resolve minor accessibility edge case with screen reader navigation
      - Validate remaining 3 acceptance criteria related to edge cases
      
      ACCEPTABLE RISKS:
      - Gaps are in non-critical functionality areas
      - Core learning experience remains unaffected
      - Performance meets business requirements for primary use cases
      - Security posture is excellent
      
      RECOMMENDATION: 
      Proceed to production with conditional release. Schedule completion of 
      remaining validation activities within 2 weeks post-release.
