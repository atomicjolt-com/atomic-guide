  CRITICAL SECURITY REVIEW - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
  
  This comprehensive security review has identified critical vulnerabilities that create
  severe security risks:
  
  1. AUTHENTICATION BYPASS: Hard-coded fallback secret "default-dev-secret" allows attackers
     to forge message signatures and bypass authentication entirely.
  
  2. DOMAIN VALIDATION BYPASS: The origin validation logic can be bypassed using malicious
     subdomains (e.g., evil.instructure.com.malicious.com would pass validation).
  
  3. DATA LEAKAGE RISK: Target origin determination fallbacks could send sensitive student
     data to unintended origins.
  
  While the implementation demonstrates excellent architectural design and all 20 acceptance
  criteria have been addressed, these security vulnerabilities are critical blockers for
  production deployment. The code quality is high (A-), test coverage is good (B+), but
  security posture is unacceptable (C).
  
  RECOMMENDATION: Development team must address all P0 security fixes immediately before
  any further testing or deployment. Once security issues are resolved, this will be an
  exceptional implementation ready for production use.
