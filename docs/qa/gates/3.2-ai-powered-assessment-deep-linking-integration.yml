progress_summary: |
  Significant improvements since initial review (2025-08-30 10:00):
  
  RESOLVED:
  ✅ Test coverage improved: 0% → 70% (76 test cases added)
  ✅ Security vulnerability fixed: JSON injection resolved with Zod validation
  ✅ Server handlers implemented: deepLinking.ts and assessmentLaunch.ts created
  ✅ Error handling improved: Proper boundaries and recovery mechanisms
  
  REMAINING BLOCKERS:
  ❌ Database: Migration files not created for assessment tables
  ❌ Build: 100+ TypeScript compilation errors
  ❌ Dependencies: Missing validateLTIToken utility
  ❌ Integration: LTI AGS not fully connected
  
  Developer has addressed critical security issues and testing gaps effectively.
  Infrastructure completion is now the primary blocker for deployment.
