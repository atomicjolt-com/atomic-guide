title: AI-Powered Assessment Deep Linking Integration - Status Discrepancy Review
date: 2025-08-31
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
gate_status: FAIL
severity: CRITICAL

issue_summary: |
  Story marked as Done with 0% task completion (0 of 11 main tasks, 0 of 55 subtasks checked).
  This represents a critical project tracking failure requiring immediate correction.

evidence:
  story_status: Done
  tasks_complete: 0/11
  subtasks_complete: 0/55
  completion_percentage: 0%
  
  claimed_achievements:
    - 315 tests passing
    - All 20 acceptance criteria met
    - AI generation and preview implemented
    
  actual_task_status:
    - All 11 main tasks unchecked
    - All 55 subtasks unchecked
    - Direct contradiction with Done status

discrepancy_analysis:
  files_created:
    - Assessment components exist
    - Server handlers created
    - Tests written
    - Grade passback service implemented
    
  probable_cause: |
    Development work appears completed based on file evidence,
    but task tracking was never updated to reflect progress.
    This is a process failure, not necessarily a development failure.

required_actions:
  immediate:
    - Verify actual implementation status with npm test
    - Check existence of all claimed files
    - Test functionality of grade passback service
    - Validate analytics dashboard implementation
    
  resolution_options:
    option_1: Update all task checkboxes to match actual completion
    option_2: Change story status from Done to In Progress
    option_3: Conduct detailed audit to determine true status

gate_decision:
  status: FAIL
  rationale: |
    Story integrity compromised. Cannot have Done status with 0% documented
    task completion. This violates basic project management principles and
    makes accurate status reporting impossible.
    
blocking_items:
  - Status/task discrepancy must be resolved
  - Either update tasks or change status
  - Cannot proceed with contradictory tracking

recommendation: |
  CRITICAL: Immediately reconcile story status with task completion.
  This is blocking accurate project reporting and must be resolved
  before any other work proceeds on this story.
