# Quality assurance commitment
qa_commitment: |
  This comprehensive quality gate framework provides 18 detailed validation gates
  covering all aspects of cross-course intelligence implementation. While the story
  requirements are well-analyzed and testing frameworks are thoroughly designed,
  critical technical feasibility and data generation questions must be resolved
  before development can proceed with confidence.
  
  The quality gates are designed to ensure student privacy protection, educational
  effectiveness, and system performance. All gates include measurable criteria,
  automated testing specifications, and evidence requirements.

# POST-IMPLEMENTATION: Required actions for story completion

    - "Replace any type usage in KnowledgeDependencyMapper with proper TypeScript interface"
    - "Fix all ESLint violations and remove inappropriate console statements"
    - "Validate repository pattern compliance through testing"
  before_production:
    - "Comprehensive integration testing with repository pattern compliance"
    - "Performance validation for cross-course analytics at scale"
    - "End-to-end testing of FERPA compliance with actual multi-course scenarios"

# FINAL DECISION: Implementation must be refactored before production release
final_decision: |
  GATE STATUS: FAIL
  
  While the feature demonstrates strong architectural thinking and comprehensive scope,
  critical violations of project architectural standards prevent production deployment.
  The repository pattern is consistently bypassed, type safety is compromised, and
  code quality issues exist.
  
  The privacy framework implementation shows exemplary FERPA compliance. However,
  the core services must be refactored to meet architectural requirements before
  this implementation can be considered production-ready.
  
  Recommendation: Move story back to "In Development" status until critical 
  violations are resolved.
