    Phase 2: ML-based prerequisite gap prediction with instructor alerts  
    Phase 3: Full cross-course intelligence with advanced analytics dashboard
  critical_dependencies:
    - "Canvas multi-course data integration architecture"
    - "Privacy framework extension for cross-course scenarios"
    - "ML infrastructure capacity assessment"
  success_metrics_priority:
    - "Privacy compliance: 100% (non-negotiable)"
    - "Cross-course correlation accuracy: >80%"
    - "System performance under load: <30s for 10-course analytics"

# Quality assurance commitment
qa_commitment: |
  This comprehensive quality gate framework provides 18 detailed validation gates
  covering all aspects of cross-course intelligence implementation. While the story
  requirements are well-analyzed and testing frameworks are thoroughly designed,
  critical technical feasibility and data generation questions must be resolved
  before development can proceed with confidence.
  
  The quality gates are designed to ensure student privacy protection, educational
  effectiveness, and system performance. All gates include measurable criteria,
  automated testing specifications, and evidence requirements.
