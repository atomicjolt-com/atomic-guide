  QUALITY GATES FOR STORY 7.1 - CANVAS POSTMESSAGE INTEGRATION

  These quality gates establish the mandatory validation criteria for the Canvas postMessage
  integration implementation. All gates must pass before production deployment.

  KEY REQUIREMENTS:

  1. SECURITY (MANDATORY - 100% PASS RATE)
     - Origin validation must block ALL malicious attempts
     - HMAC integrity must be cryptographically sound
     - Content sanitization must prevent ALL XSS vectors
     - Repository pattern compliance is non-negotiable

  2. PERFORMANCE (CRITICAL THRESHOLDS)
     - Content extraction: <500ms P95 latency
     - Database writes: <100ms P95 latency
     - Concurrent users: Support 1000+ sessions
     - Memory efficiency: <100MB per session

  3. CANVAS COMPATIBILITY (95% MINIMUM)
     - Multi-environment support across Canvas deployments
     - Browser compatibility with >95% coverage
     - Graceful degradation for limited environments

  4. FUNCTIONAL ACCURACY (HIGH THRESHOLDS)
     - Page type detection: >95% accuracy
     - Metadata extraction: >90% completeness
     - Concept extraction: >85% accuracy
     - Context tracking: >95% reliability

  5. INTEGRATION QUALITY (100% PASS RATE)
     - Seamless integration with existing systems
     - Data integrity across service boundaries
     - Real-time context propagation <100ms

  CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
  - Repository pattern compliance (addresses QA violation)
  - HMAC key management implementation (addresses security gap)
  - Content sanitization framework (addresses XSS prevention)
  - Performance validation under realistic load
  - Canvas environment compatibility testing

  ROLLBACK CONDITIONS:
  - ANY security gate failure triggers immediate rollback
  - Performance thresholds exceeded for sustained periods
  - Canvas compatibility below minimum thresholds
  - Integration failures affecting existing functionality

  VALIDATION APPROACH:
  - Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
  - Progressive load testing with realistic scenarios
  - Multi-environment Canvas testing
  - Continuous monitoring post-deployment

  These gates ensure the Canvas integration meets the high security, performance, and
  reliability standards required for production deployment while addressing all critical
  issues identified in the QA review.
