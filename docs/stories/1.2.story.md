# Story 1.2: AI Guide Chat Interface MVP

## Status

Ready for Done

## Story

**As a** student using the LMS,
**I want** to access an AI Guide assistant via a floating action button that opens a chat interface,
**so that** I can ask questions about my current course content and receive immediate, contextual help without leaving the LMS page.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Floating Action Button (FAB) is displayed on all LTI launch pages with proper positioning (bottom-right) and Atomic Jolt Yellow (#FFDD00) styling
2. FAB is accessible via keyboard navigation (Tab) and screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels
3. Clicking FAB opens a chat window interface with header, message area, and input field
4. Chat window can be minimized, maximized, and closed with state preserved during session
5. Chat interface extracts and understands current LMS page context (course, module, assignment)
6. Users can type messages and send them via Enter key or Send button
7. Chat displays user messages (right-aligned) and AI responses (left-aligned) with proper styling
8. Chat interface is fully responsive across mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints
9. Chat conversation state is managed client-side with Redux Toolkit
10. Chat messages are sent to backend API endpoint `/api/chat/message` with JWT authentication
11. Chat interface handles loading states, errors, and rate limiting gracefully
12. Basic chat conversation history is maintained for the current session

  reducerPath: 'api',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/api',
    prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
      const token = (getState() as RootState).jwt;
      if (token) {
        headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
      }
      return headers;
    },
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Chat'],
});
```

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework:** Vitest with React Testing Library
**Test File Location:** Colocated with components (\*.test.tsx pattern)
**Coverage Targets:** 80% for business logic, 60% for UI components

**Required Test Patterns:**

```typescript
// Component test example
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { ChatFAB } from './ChatFAB';
import { store } from '../../store';

describe('ChatFAB', () => {
  it('renders with correct styling', () => {
    render(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <ChatFAB />
      </Provider>
    );
    const button = screen.getByLabelText('Atomic Guide Assistant - Click for help');
    expect(button).toHaveStyle({ backgroundColor: '#FFDD00' });
  });
});
```

**Test Data Factory:**

```typescript
// tests/factories/chatFactory.ts
export const chatMessageFactory = (overrides?: Partial<ChatMessage>) => ({
  id: 'test-message-id',
  content: 'Test message content',
  sender: 'user',
  timestamp: '2025-01-20T10:00:00Z',
  ...overrides,
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: High-quality implementation demonstrating excellent TypeScript practices, comprehensive test coverage, and proper architectural patterns. The React/Redux implementation follows best practices with proper typing, immutable state management, and accessibility support. However, critical security vulnerabilities require immediate attention before production deployment.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/api/handlers/chat.ts
  - **Change**: Added input sanitization for message content
  - **Why**: Prevent XSS vulnerability from unsanitized user input
  - **How**: Validates and escapes HTML entities in user messages before processing

- **File**: src/api/handlers/chat.ts  
  - **Change**: Added message length validation (max 5000 chars)
  - **Why**: Prevent abuse and ensure system stability
  - **How**: Returns 400 error for messages exceeding limit

- **File**: src/api/handlers/chat.ts
  - **Change**: Removed default JWT secret fallback
  - **Why**: Security vulnerability - weak default secrets in production
  - **How**: Enforces JWT_SECRET environment variable requirement

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent TypeScript patterns, proper RTK Query usage
- Project Structure: ✓ All files correctly organized per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ 80%+ coverage achieved with comprehensive test suite
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 12 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated

### Improvements Checklist
