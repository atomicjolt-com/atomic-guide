## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 3.1 successfully implemented LMS content extraction via postMessage API, creating a foundation for content-aware assessments. The ContentAnalyzer service can identify key concepts, learning objectives, and assessment opportunities from LMS pages. This content awareness should be leveraged to generate contextually relevant assessment questions and provide targeted feedback based on the actual course material students are reading.

### Technical Architecture

**Deep Linking Flow:**
```
Canvas Assignment Creation → Deep Link Request → 
Assessment Builder UI → Configuration Save → 
JWT Signed Content Item → Return to Canvas → 
Student Launch → Assessment with AI Chat
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural foundations with proper vertical slice organization and React 19 patterns. The UI components are well-structured with comprehensive JSDoc documentation and proper TypeScript typing. However, the implementation is incomplete (server-side pending) and has critical testing gaps that must be addressed before production readiness.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review as the implementation is partial and requires completion of server-side components before architectural improvements can be applied effectively.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✗] Import path violations found (relative imports instead of aliases)
- Project Structure: [✓] Proper vertical slice architecture implemented
- Testing Strategy: [✗] **CRITICAL: 0% test coverage - no tests exist**
- All ACs Met: [✗] Only 6 of 20 acceptance criteria partially implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues (Must Fix):**
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite (minimum 80% coverage required)
- [ ] Fix import path violations in DeepLinkingInterface.tsx (line 13)
- [ ] Add runtime validation for JSON parsing in assessmentDeepLink.ts (line 157)
- [ ] Implement missing server-side handlers (deepLinking.ts, assessmentLaunch.ts)
- [ ] Create database migrations for assessment tables

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Implement AI question generation functionality (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Add grade passback service for LTI AGS integration
- [ ] Create assessment analytics dashboard components
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- [ ] Implement RTK Query for server state management

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add code splitting for assessment components (performance)
- [ ] Implement memoization for expensive operations
- [ ] Add input sanitization for assessment titles/descriptions
- [ ] Create integration tests for Canvas mobile compatibility
- [ ] Add rate limiting tests for deep link creation

### Security Review

**Concerns Found:**
1. **JSON Injection Risk**: Direct JSON.parse() without schema validation in extractAssessmentConfig
2. **Missing Sanitization**: User-provided titles and descriptions not sanitized before rendering
3. **Type Assertion Bypass**: Using `as AssessmentConfig` without validation

**Recommendations:**
- Always validate with Zod schemas before type assertions
- Implement DOMPurify for user content sanitization
- Add CSP headers for embedded assessment content

### Performance Considerations

1. **Bundle Size**: Large component imports without lazy loading
2. **Re-rendering**: Missing React.memo and useMemo optimizations
3. **Form Handling**: Direct DOM manipulation instead of React patterns

**Optimization Needed:**
- Implement dynamic imports for assessment components
- Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use controlled components for form handling

### Files Modified During Review

None - Review only, no modifications performed due to incomplete implementation status.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/3.2-ai-powered-assessment-deep-linking-integration.yml

**Critical Blockers:**
- Zero test coverage (violates 80% requirement)
- Only 30% of acceptance criteria implemented
- Missing essential server-side components
- Security vulnerabilities in JSON handling

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]

**Story cannot proceed to Done status until:**
1. Complete test coverage implementation (minimum 80%)
2. Fix all critical security issues
3. Complete server-side implementation
4. Verify all 20 acceptance criteria are met

**Note to Developer:** The UI foundation is solid, but the missing tests and server implementation are blocking issues. Priority should be on adding tests first, then completing the server-side handlers. The import path violations are minor but should be fixed for consistency.
