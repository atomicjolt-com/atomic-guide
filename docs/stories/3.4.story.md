  .analytics-dashboard {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 12px;
    padding: 8px;
  }
}

/* Mobile landscape - expanded */
@media (min-width: 480px) and (orientation: landscape) {
  .analytics-dashboard {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 16px;
  }
}

/* Tablet portrait - enhanced layout */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .analytics-dashboard {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 16px;
  }
}
```

**Touch Interaction Standards:**

- Minimum touch target: 44x44px with 8px spacing
- Chart interactions: 8px minimum touch zone around data points

const BenchmarkComparison = lazy(() => import('./BenchmarkComparison'));

// Virtualization for large data lists
const VirtualizedExportPreview = lazy(() => import('./VirtualizedExportPreview'));

// Progressive image loading for charts
const useProgressiveChart = (data: ChartData) => {
  const [loadedData, setLoadedData] = useState(data.slice(0, 10));
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setLoadedData(data);
    }, 100);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [data]);
  
  return loadedData;
};
```

### Privacy and Compliance

**Benchmark Privacy Protection:**

- Differential privacy with ε ≤ 1.0 for all peer comparisons
- Minimum sample size of 10 students for any benchmark display
- Statistical confidence intervals required for all comparative metrics
- Clear opt-in process with granular control over comparison types

**Export Audit Trail:**

  exportId: string;
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  dataTypes: string[];
  recordCount: number;
  purpose: string;
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  complianceFlags: string[];
}
```
