  };
  profileConfidence: number; // 0-1 scale based on data volume
  dataCollectionLevel: 'minimal' | 'standard' | 'comprehensive';
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  lastAnalyzedAt: Date;
}

interface CognitiveAttribute {
  attribute: string;
  value: number | string;
  confidence: number;
  dataPoints: number;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  evidenceSource: 'assessment' | 'chat' | 'timing' | 'behavior';
}
