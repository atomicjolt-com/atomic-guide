## Story

**As a** student using Atomic Guide across multiple courses and learning sessions,
**I want** the system to proactively recognize when I'm struggling with specific concepts or learning approaches and automatically suggest personalized interventions,
**so that** I can overcome learning obstacles before they become major barriers and receive guidance tailored to my unique cognitive patterns.

**As an** instructor monitoring student learning progress,
**I want** to receive intelligent alerts when students exhibit early warning signs of struggle or disengagement based on their behavioral patterns,
**so that** I can intervene with targeted support before students fall behind or become overwhelmed.

**As a** student with established learning preferences,
**I want** the AI to predict which types of explanations, practice problems, and study approaches will be most effective for me personally,
**so that** I can focus my study time on methods that accelerate my learning rather than generic approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria

    // Multi-variate time series analysis
    // Combines interaction timing, help frequency, error patterns
    // Uses ensemble methods (LSTM + Random Forest + SVM)
    
    const timeSeriesFeatures = this.extractTimeSeriesFeatures(behavioralTimeSeries);
    const cognitiveFeatures = this.extractCognitiveFeatures(behavioralTimeSeries);
    const contextFeatures = this.extractContextFeatures(behavioralTimeSeries);
    
    const struggleRisk = this.ensemblePredict({
      timeSeriesFeatures,
      cognitiveFeatures,
      contextFeatures,
    });

}
```

**Learning Velocity Forecasting:**

```typescript
class LearningVelocityForecaster {
  forecastMasteryTime(
    cognitiveProfile: LearnerDNAProfile,
    targetConcept: ConceptMetadata
  ): VelocityForecast {
    // Bayesian inference with prior knowledge from similar profiles
    // Accounts for concept difficulty, prerequisite knowledge, cognitive load
