**Implementation Assessment:** Ready for development with clear technical specifications
**Dependencies:** Stories 4.1 & 4.2 (Learner DNA Foundation) - ✅ COMPLETED

## Story

**As a** student using Atomic Guide across LMS pages,
**I want** the system to automatically detect when I'm struggling with content and proactively offer help through the chat interface,
**so that** I can receive timely assistance before becoming overwhelmed and maintain productive learning momentum.

**As an** instructor monitoring student learning,
**I want** to receive alerts when the system detects students are struggling based on real-time behavioral patterns,
**so that** I can provide targeted support and intervention before academic problems escalate.

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** the struggle detection to operate reliably using Durable Objects for real-time pattern analysis,
**so that** the proactive interventions scale across multiple concurrent users without performance degradation.

interface StruggleEvent {
  id: string;
  learner_id: string;
  session_id: string;
  struggle_signals: {
    hover_duration: number;
    scroll_frequency: number;
    idle_periods: number[];
    help_requests: number;
  };
  intervention_delivered?: {
    type: 'proactive_chat' | 'content_suggestion';
    timestamp: Date;
    effectiveness_score?: number;
  };
  created_at: Date;
}

interface BehavioralSignal {

  signal_type: 'hover' | 'scroll' | 'idle' | 'click' | 'help_request';
  duration_ms: number;
  element_context: string;
  page_content_hash: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Canvas PostMessage Integration Architecture
[Source: docs/architecture/12-canvas-postmessage-integration-architecture.md]

**Secure Communication Setup:**
- Use MessageChannel for secure bidirectional communication with Canvas
- Validate trusted origins: `['https://canvas.instructure.com', 'https://*.instructure.com']`
- Implement fallback DOM extraction for unsupported Canvas environments
- Deploy custom JavaScript (`canvas-monitor.js`) for comprehensive behavioral monitoring

**Content Extraction Strategy:**
- Primary: Use Canvas `lti.getPageContent` API for supported page types
- Fallback: DOM extraction targeting `.content, #content, [data-testid="content"]`
- Extract page context including course, module, assignment metadata
- Generate content hash for change detection and intervention context

### Backend Architecture Integration
[Source: docs/architecture/12-backend-architecture.md]

**Repository Pattern Compliance:**
- All database operations MUST follow Handler → Service → Repository → Database flow
- NEVER access `db.getDb()` directly from services or handlers
- Use BaseRepository class for consistent CRUD operations and validation

**Durable Objects Implementation:**
```typescript
// StruggleDetectorDO extends DurableObject
export class StruggleDetectorDO {
  constructor(private state: DurableObjectState, private env: Env) {}
  
  async processSignal(signal: BehavioralSignal): Promise<StruggleAnalysis> {
    // Real-time processing with <100ms response requirement
    // Maintain session state in Durable Object storage
    // Trigger interventions based on threshold analysis
  }
}
```

**Service Architecture:**
- `StruggleDetectionEngine` coordinates between repositories and Durable Objects  
- `EarlyWarningService` handles instructor notifications with privacy compliance
- `ChatService` enhanced with proactive intervention capabilities
- All services use dependency injection pattern for testability

### Frontend Architecture Integration  
[Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]

**React Component Structure:**
```typescript
// ProactiveChatTrigger component for non-intrusive interventions
interface ProactiveChatTriggerProps {
  onAccept: () => void;
  onDismiss: () => void;
  interventionMessage: string;
  urgencyLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}
```

**Redux Store Integration:**
- Add `struggletDetection` slice to manage real-time behavioral signals
- Use RTK Query for struggle pattern API endpoints
- Implement WebSocket middleware for real-time intervention delivery
- Persist intervention preferences in sessionStorage

**Canvas Integration Hooks:**
- `useCanvasPostMessage()` - Handle secure message communication  
- `useCanvasMonitor()` - Track behavioral signals and page context
- `useStruggleDetection()` - Monitor struggle analysis results
- `useProactiveChat()` - Manage intervention triggers and responses
