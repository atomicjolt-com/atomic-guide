## Story

**As a** student taking multiple Canvas courses with interconnected concepts (e.g., Algebra → Calculus → Physics),
**I want** the system to understand knowledge dependencies across my courses and predict where gaps in prerequisite understanding might impact my performance in advanced topics,
**so that** I can receive proactive recommendations to review foundational concepts before encountering difficulties in dependent courses.

**As an** instructor teaching advanced courses that build on prerequisites,
**I want** visibility into students' prerequisite knowledge gaps detected across their course history and real-time performance correlations,
**so that** I can provide targeted support for foundational concepts and adapt my teaching to address common knowledge gaps before they impact student success.

**As an** academic advisor supporting students across multiple courses,
**I want** cross-course learning analytics that identify knowledge dependency patterns and predict academic risk across a student's entire course load,
**so that** I can provide holistic academic support and early intervention strategies that consider the interconnected nature of learning.

## QA Results

**QA Review Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Reviewed By:** QA Test Architect Agent  
**Review Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL REQUIRED** - Critical revisions needed before development

### Executive Summary

Story 6.1 presents valuable cross-course intelligence capabilities but requires significant revisions for testability, technical feasibility, and implementation specificity. The story is **NOT READY** for development in current form.

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

#### 1. **TESTABILITY GAPS (CRITICAL PRIORITY)**
- **Issue:** Quantitative acceptance criteria lack measurement methodologies
- **Examples:**
  - AC 1: ">80% accuracy in prerequisite relationships" - No definition of ground truth
  - AC 3: "R>0.6 correlation" - No measurement window or methodology specified
  - AC 8: ">85% course effectiveness accuracy" - No baseline defined
- **Resolution Required:** Define measurement frameworks, ground truth sources, and validation approaches for all quantitative metrics

#### 2. **TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY RISKS (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Cross-Course Data Integration:** Current LTI architecture is single-course focused; cross-course persistent identity mapping undefined
- **ML Infrastructure Requirements:** Advanced ML capabilities assumed without current system support; training data sources unspecified
- **Performance Targets:** "Cross-course analytics in <30 seconds for 10-course loads" may exceed Cloudflare Workers capacity
- **Resolution Required:** Conduct technical feasibility assessment and proof-of-concept development

#### 3. **PRIVACY COMPLIANCE COMPLEXITIES (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Cross-Course Consent:** Current privacy framework is course-scoped; inheritance rules undefined
- **Anonymization Claims:** "Zero re-identification possible" (AC 14) unrealistic with rich behavioral data
- **Data Retention Conflicts:** Different course policies may conflict for cross-course analytics
- **Resolution Required:** Extend privacy framework specification for cross-course scenarios

#### 4. **TESTING STRATEGY INADEQUACIES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Synthetic Data:** "500+ course sequences with ground truth" creation approach undefined
- **Integration Testing:** Multi-course Canvas environment setup requirements missing
- **Privacy Testing:** Cross-course consent enforcement testing scenarios incomplete
- **Resolution Required:** Develop realistic testing approach with detailed implementation plan

### Acceptance Criteria Assessment

#### Problematic Criteria Requiring Revision:
- **AC 1-4:** Metrics reasonable but measurement methodology missing
- **AC 7:** Learning efficiency improvement - no baseline framework
- **AC 11:** Chat context "applicable courses" undefined
- **AC 14:** Zero re-identification technically unrealistic
- **AC 16:** 24-hour data removal complex with distributed analytics

#### Well-Defined Criteria:
- **AC 13, 15, 16:** Privacy consent specifications concrete
- **AC 9, 12:** Time-based criteria measurable
- **AC 2:** Prediction window testable

### Recommended Story Phasing

#### Phase 1 (MVP) - Recommended Starting Point:
- Basic cross-course correlation analysis (2-3 course sequences)
- Simple prerequisite detection without ML prediction
- Consent extension for cross-course sharing
- Performance correlation analysis

#### Phase 2 - Advanced Intelligence:
- ML-based prerequisite gap prediction
- Cross-course chat enhancement
- Advanced analytics dashboard

#### Phase 3 - Full Feature Set:
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Learning path optimization
- Advanced privacy controls

### Required Actions Before Development

1. **Define Measurement Methodologies** for all quantitative acceptance criteria
2. **Conduct Technical Feasibility Assessment** for cross-course data integration
3. **Extend Privacy Framework Specifications** for cross-course scenarios
4. **Develop Detailed Testing Strategy** with realistic data generation approach
5. **Consider Story Phasing** to reduce initial complexity and risk

### Integration Points Validation

✅ **Story 4.1-4.2 Foundation:** Well-documented, adequate for extension  
✅ **Story 5.1 Integration:** Clear integration points identified  
⚠️ **Canvas LTI Integration:** Requires extension for cross-course data sharing  
❌ **ML Infrastructure:** Current system lacks required advanced ML capabilities  
❌ **Performance Requirements:** May exceed current infrastructure limits

### Recommendation

**HOLD DEVELOPMENT** until critical issues are resolved. Recommend starting with Phase 1 MVP scope after addressing testability and technical feasibility concerns.

### Quality Gates Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/6.1-cross-course-intelligence-foundation-knowledge-dependency-mapping-and-performance-correlation.yml

**Quality Gate Summary**: Comprehensive quality gates defined (18 gates across 5 categories) with extensive validation frameworks, automated testing specifications, and evidence requirements. Critical feasibility concerns require resolution before development.
