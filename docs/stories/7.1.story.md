## Story

**As an** instructor using Atomic Guide for in-class activities,
**I want** the system to automatically extract and maintain awareness of current Canvas page content when students are reading assignments, taking quizzes, or viewing course materials,
**so that** I can embed contextual AI-powered assessment checkpoints that reference specific content and learning objectives from the exact material students are engaging with.

**As a** student working through Canvas course materials,
**I want** Atomic Guide to understand what content I'm currently viewing so that any embedded assessments or chat interactions can provide relevant, contextual help,
**so that** I receive targeted support that directly relates to the specific material I'm studying without having to repeat or explain my current context.

**As a** system administrator,

- Nonce-based replay attack prevention
- Rate limiting (60 signals/minute per session)

**CRITICAL ISSUES TO RESOLVE:**
1. **Repository Pattern Violation**: `CanvasPostMessageService` uses direct database access (`this.db.getDb()`) - violates architecture rules
2. **HMAC Key Management**: No key rotation strategy specified
3. **Content Sanitization**: Missing XSS protection for extracted Canvas content
4. **Cross-Site Framing**: iframe security policies need strengthening

#### ⚠️ **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS - OPTIMIZATION REQUIRED**

**Challenging Performance Targets:**
- Signal processing <100ms P95 (aggressive for D1 database writes)
- Content extraction within 500ms (with AI analysis)
- Resource constraints: <5% CPU, <10MB memory

**Potential Bottlenecks:**
- D1 batch writes may struggle with 60 signals/minute/user at scale
- Workers AI calls could add 200-500ms latency to content analysis
- Multiple Canvas tabs per user increases concurrent load
- Real-time content monitoring could impact Canvas page performance

#### 🔴 **INTEGRATION RISKS - HIGH RISK AREAS**

**Canvas Dependencies:**
- Canvas API version compatibility (updates could break extraction)
- Canvas rate limiting may restrict content access
- Mobile Canvas app has limited postMessage support
- Institution-specific Canvas configurations vary widely

**System Integration Complexity:**
- Integration with 4 existing services (chat, struggle detection, learner DNA, cross-course)
- Database schema spans 9+ existing migrations
- Must operate within LTI 1.3 security constraints

#### ✅ **PRIVACY COMPLIANCE - WELL ADDRESSED**

**Compliance Verified:**
- FERPA requirements explicitly addressed (AC #8)
- Data minimization: only metadata and references stored
- Automated retention and purging workflows specified
- Integration with existing `PrivacyControlService`
- Course participant access restrictions enforced

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

#### **MUST RESOLVE BEFORE DEVELOPMENT:**

1. **Security Architecture Violation**
   - Fix repository pattern violation in `CanvasPostMessageService`

### Canvas Compatibility Concerns

#### **Medium Risk Canvas Issues:**

1. **Canvas API Evolution**
   - Canvas regularly updates APIs and DOM structure
   - Content extraction may break with Canvas updates
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust fallback mechanisms

2. **Institution-Specific Variations**
   - Canvas instances have varying API permissions
   - Custom Canvas themes may affect DOM extraction
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive multi-tenant testing required

3. **Mobile Canvas Limitations**
   - Canvas mobile apps have limited postMessage support
   - Mobile browsers may have different security restrictions
   - **Mitigation**: Define mobile fallback strategy

### PostMessage Security Assessment

#### **Security Framework Evaluation:**

**Strong Security Measures:**
