## Story

**As an** instructor preparing Canvas assignments with embedded AI-powered assessment checkpoints,
**I want** an intuitive deep linking configuration interface that allows me to select specific content locations within my assignments and embed contextual assessment activities,
**so that** I can strategically place formative assessments at critical learning junctures that provide real-time comprehension feedback and mastery-based progression for my students.

**As a** student encountering embedded assessment checkpoints while working through Canvas assignments,
**I want** these assessments to seamlessly integrate with my current learning context without disrupting my workflow,
**so that** I can receive timely feedback on my understanding and progress through content at an appropriate pace without feeling like assessments are disconnected from what I'm studying.

**As a** system administrator overseeing LTI deep linking implementations across multiple Canvas courses,
**I want** the deep linking configuration system to operate reliably within Canvas's deep linking specifications while maintaining security and performance standards,
**so that** instructors can confidently embed assessment checkpoints without compromising system integrity or violating institutional data policies.
