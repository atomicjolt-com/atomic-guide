- AC8: ">85% course effectiveness accuracy" - No baseline comparison framework

**Required Actions:**
- Define authoritative ground truth sources for prerequisite relationships
- Establish correlation measurement methodologies and time windows
- Create baseline frameworks for course effectiveness comparisons

### 2. **CRITICAL: Technical Feasibility Gaps**
**Impact:** Core features may be technically impossible
**Issues:**

- Performance targets exceeding Cloudflare Workers limits

**Required Actions:**
- Conduct technical feasibility proof-of-concept
- Validate cross-course data integration approach
- Performance capacity assessment for complex analytics

### 3. **HIGH: Privacy Framework Extensions Undefined**
**Impact:** Cannot implement privacy-compliant testing
**Issues:**
- Cross-course consent inheritance rules undefined
- "Zero re-identification" claims technically unrealistic
- Conflicting data retention policies across courses

**Required Actions:**
- Extend privacy framework for cross-course scenarios

## Conclusion

This test design strategy provides a comprehensive framework for validating Story 6.1's cross-course intelligence capabilities. However, **testing cannot proceed until the critical blockers are resolved**. The story requires significant refinement in measurement methodologies, technical feasibility validation, and privacy framework extension before development and testing can begin.

**Recommendation:** Address the critical blockers before proceeding with any development or testing activities. Consider implementing a phased approach starting with basic cross-course correlation (Phase 1 MVP) after blockers are resolved.

**Next Steps:**
1. Resolve measurement methodology definitions
2. Conduct technical feasibility proof of concept
3. Extend privacy framework for cross-course scenarios
4. Revise story acceptance criteria based on technical findings
5. Begin development with comprehensive testing implementation
