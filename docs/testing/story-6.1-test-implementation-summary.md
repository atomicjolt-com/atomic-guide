## Critical Blockers (MUST RESOLVE)

### 1. **Measurement Methodologies Undefined** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Impact:** Cannot validate any quantitative acceptance criteria  
**Examples:**
- AC 1: ">80% accuracy in prerequisite relationships" - No ground truth source
- AC 3: "R>0.6 correlation" - No measurement window defined
- AC 8: ">85% course effectiveness accuracy" - No baseline framework

**Required Actions:**
- Define authoritative ground truth sources for prerequisite relationships
- Establish correlation measurement methodologies and time windows
- Create baseline frameworks for course effectiveness comparisons

### 2. **Technical Feasibility Unconfirmed** ⚠️ CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Core features may be technically impossible  
**Issues:**
- Cross-course identity mapping in single-course LTI architecture
- ML infrastructure assumptions without current system support
- Performance targets exceeding Cloudflare Workers limits (>30 second analytics)

**Required Actions:**
- Conduct technical feasibility proof-of-concept
- Validate cross-course data integration approach  
- Performance capacity assessment for complex analytics

### 3. **Privacy Framework Incomplete** ⚠️ HIGH
**Impact:** Cannot implement privacy-compliant testing  
**Issues:**
- Cross-course consent inheritance rules undefined
- "Zero re-identification" claims technically unrealistic
- Conflicting data retention policies across courses

**Required Actions:**
- Extend privacy framework for cross-course scenarios
- Define realistic anonymization standards
- Resolve cross-course data retention conflicts

4. **Continuous Validation:** Regular testing and measurement validation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Define Measurement Methodologies:** Highest priority for all quantitative AC
2. **Conduct Technical Feasibility Study:** Validate core cross-course approaches
3. **Extend Privacy Framework:** Resolve cross-course privacy control gaps
4. **Assess System Capacity:** Validate performance targets against platform limits

### Development Approach
1. **Start with Phase 1 MVP:** Basic correlation after blockers resolved
2. **Establish Continuous Testing:** Quality gates validation throughout development
3. **Prioritize Privacy Controls:** Implement privacy-by-design principles
4. **Monitor Performance Continuously:** Track against capacity limits

### Testing Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Automation:** All quality gates automated where possible
2. **Realistic Test Data:** Invest in high-quality synthetic data generation
3. **Continuous Integration:** Test suite integration with development workflow
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time performance tracking and alerting

## Conclusion

The test design strategy for Story 6.1 is comprehensive and addresses all acceptance criteria with measurable quality gates. However, **testing cannot proceed until the critical blockers are resolved**. The story requires significant technical and measurement framework development before implementation can begin.

**Priority Recommendation:** Address measurement methodology definition as the highest priority, followed by technical feasibility validation and privacy framework extension. Consider implementing a phased approach starting with basic cross-course correlation (Phase 1 MVP) after blockers are resolved.

The test implementation files provide a solid foundation for validation once the underlying issues are addressed, with detailed quality gates, synthetic data requirements, and performance validation frameworks ready for execution.
